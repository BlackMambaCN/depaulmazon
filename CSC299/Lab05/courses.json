Students in this experience will learn about the history of scrapbooks and will begin the process of decoding the relationships of creativity, art, and craft in this pursuit that is sweeping the nation. Topics will include the definition of scrapbooking and its development in American culture; the ways in which art and craft intersect in the scrapbook; how to get started with a scrapbook; the nature of creativity and its impact in scrapbooking; and the construction of meaningful works of art and craft.

It is not surprising that many professionals, no matter how accomplished they are in their area of expertise, are anxious when they have to write. And, writing often becomes a point of contention when people on the job don't agree on whether a piece of writing is effective or how to go about improving it. Those who delegate responsibility for writing to others often feel frustrated that they end up having to do the work themselves - a situation that invariably leads to their employees feeling criticized and insecure in their job.  Needless to say, the duplication of work effort, the loss of productivity, and the inevitable bad feelings undermine the work environment, often leading to individuals resigning or being dismissed.

Those interested in art will learn that pilgrims chose to go to the best shrines, so the growing towns on the roads leading to the Holy Land had more than religious motivations to beautify their shrines and churches with the works of art and architecture we see today.

Recent traditionalism sees organizations as living systems and communication as a dynamic, organismic process.

The recent debate and implementation of universal health care raises many ethical issues. Does every citizen have the right to health care? Is it the government's role to ensure that this happens? What economic rights does a citizen have? Should the government foster entitlement programs? How does the current US health care system compare with other industrialized nations' systems?

How can the nurturing across generations be balanced with the independence of the individual? What are the implications for workplace policies, public policy, and community health?
